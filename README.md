# rapid_fire_tickets

This chrome addin will constantly refresh the [Transformus tickets sales](http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/614931?date=1017125)

## Installation

1. Download the [zip file](https://github.com/KevinColemanInc/rapid_fire_tickets/archive/master.zip)
2. Unzip it
3. In Chrome to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/) and click "Load unpacked extensions"
4. Navigate to the unziped location of the file.
5. Sign into your [http://www.brownpapertickets.com](http://www.brownpapertickets.com) account
5. Open a bunch of tabs in chrome and navigate them all to: [http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/614931](http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/614931)


## Notes

I would be careful about opening too many tabs, because they may actually slow down the process.  In experimentation, I was able to grab 2 tickets to an event I created with 12 tabs within 10 seconds of the release.

This currently attempts to grab the maximum amount of tickets (2).

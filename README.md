# Announcement
It looks like they are going to be adding a coupon code to the process.  My guess is they are going to set the ticket price at some crazy high amount and will ask you to put in a special discount code that will be released moments before.  This will drop the price down to the expected amount.

They also say that they will ban anyone that uses this.  But to be honest, they can't tell.  They will have no idea who is using this and who isn't.  It is fare game.

With that said, I will try my very best to update the plugin as soon as possible so you can download it at your whim. 

Cheers.

This chrome addin will constantly refresh the [Transformus tickets sales](http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/614931?date=1017125) and automatically add them to your cart.  For every tab you have open, it will be like a person helping you buy tickets!

## Installation

1. Download the [zip file](https://github.com/KevinColemanInc/rapid_fire_tickets/archive/master.zip)
2. Unzip it
3. In Chrome to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/) and click "Load unpacked extensions"
4. Navigate to the unziped location of the file.
5. Sign into your [http://www.brownpapertickets.com](http://www.brownpapertickets.com) account
5. Open a bunch of tabs in chrome and navigate them all to: [http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/614931](http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/614931)


## Notes

I would be careful about opening too many tabs, because they may actually slow down the process.  In experimentation, I was able to grab 2 tickets to an event I created with 12 tabs within 10 seconds of the release.

This currently attempts to grab the maximum amount of tickets (2).

# rapid_fire_tickets

## Update 4/18 PLEASE READ
I suspect they will be adding a secret code that will be released to confuse this tool.  The code will either unlock a hidden ticket type that can be purchased, or they will adjust the price of the current ticket type to something insane and a coupon code will bring it down to the regular price.

They also say that they will ban anyone that uses this.  But to be honest, they can't tell.  They will have no idea who is using this and who isn't.  It is fare game.

With that said, I will try my very best to update the plugin as soon as possible so you can download it at your whim. 

In an effort to combat that, I have added a feature to this tool that lets you add in a code as an option.  I also added optimizations to remove image loading and disable the Google Maps from loading on the right side thus speeding the page load time.

So you know its running, the page title of the tab is changed to "Rapid Fire Engaged".

I updated the Installation instructions below.

This chrome addin will constantly refresh the [Transformus tickets sales](http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/614931?date=1017125) and automatically add them to your cart.  For every tab you have open, it will be like a person helping you buy tickets!

### IMPORTANT
Tomorrow I plan on moving my page load optimizations to its own extension.  If they do something other than a password change that kills this tool and I have to buy this by hand, I am making a seperate extension that will ONLY make the page load faster.  You should enable this new extension in incognito mode so that you won't have to fight the rapid_fire_tickets when buying tickets and can still take advantage of the speed up.

## Notes

I would be careful about opening too many tabs, because they may actually slow down the process.  In experimentation, I was able to grab 2 tickets to an event I created with 12 tabs within 10 seconds of the release.

This currently attempts to grab the maximum amount of tickets (2).
